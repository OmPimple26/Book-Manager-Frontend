# Book Manager Frontend

📚 Book Manager Frontend is a React-based UI for managing books. It connects with the Book Manager backend via RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This project is built to practice API handling in web development and demonstrates how a React app interacts with an Express-based backend in a MERN-style setup.

## ✨ Features

📖 View all books with dynamic rendering

➕ Add new books to the backend

📝 Update book details (can be implemented)

❌ Delete books from the backend

🌐 Connects with a deployed backend API on Render

⚡ Demonstrates frontend-backend integration using Fetch API

🎨 Responsive UI built with basic CSS / Tailwind (if used)
